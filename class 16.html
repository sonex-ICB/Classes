    <!-- This tutorial uses internal script after the body tag -->
    <!-- JavaScript output - 
        JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
            Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
            Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
            Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
            Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().    
    -->
    <script>
        // wrinting  "Hello world!" into  the browser console
        console.log("Hello World!");
        // open the html file 
        // right click on empty space and select inspect
        // switch to console. 
        // writing into a specific HTML element, create an element with id='demo'
        document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = 'Hello World!';
        // writting into the alert box
        window.alert("This is an Alert Box");
        // writting into directly into the HTML document
        document.write('Hello World!');
        /*
        NOTE:
            Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML
            because it writes over everything that was there before.it should only be used for testing purpose
            else be sure of the result
            using console is also only for development  purposes, 
            you can freely use an html element or alert to display content on a website

            x = a/1;

        /*
        NOTE:    
            1. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.
            2. These unique names are called identifiers.
            3. Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
            4. Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
            5. Names must begin with a letter.
            6. Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
            7. Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
            8. Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
            9. JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive. So, name,Name and NAME are three distinct variables.
